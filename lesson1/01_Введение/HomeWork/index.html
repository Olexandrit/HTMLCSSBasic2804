      <br />
      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early
        schooling was suspended <br />
        in 1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served in
        the Biafran army. After the <br />
        war he completed high-school equivalence through self-study. <br />
        He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American
        microbiologist.[5]
      </p>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following
        completion of a <br />correspondence course at the University of London.
        He received a bachelor's degree in <br />
        mathematics from Oregon State University in 1977. He later moved to
        Washington DC, receiving <br />
        in 1986 a master's degree from George Washington University in ocean and
        marine engineering,<br />
        and a second master's in applied mathematics from the University of
        Maryland. Next magazine<br />
        suggested that Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees.[6][7] During
        this time, he worked as a<br />
        civil engineer at the Bureau of Land Reclamation in Wyoming.
      </p>
      <h3>Court case and the denial of degree</h3>
      <p>
        Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan
        from 1987 through 1991.<br />
        His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external
        examiners and thus he was<br />
        not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that
        the decision was a<br />
        violation of his civil rights and that the university had discriminated
        against him in several ways<br />
        because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal
        to the Michigan state<br />
        Court of Appeals.[8]
      </p>
      <h2>Supercomputing</h2>
      <p>
        Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the
        CM-2 massively-parallel<br />
        computer. The application used computational fluid dynamics for
        oil-reservoir modeling. He<br />
        received a prize in "price/performance" category, with a performance
        figure of about 400<br />
        Mflops/$1M.[15] The winner in the "performance" category, was also the
        winner of the<br />
        Price/performance category, but unable to receive two prizes. Mobil
        Research and Thinking<br />
        Machines, used the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the
        higher ratio of 500<br />
        Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry.[3][2] His method
        involved each<br />
        microprocessor communicating with six neighbors.[10]
      </p>
      <p>
        Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time
        approach to reservoir<br />
        modeling.[1]
